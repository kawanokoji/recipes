INGREDIENTS

2 chicken carcasses left over from roast chicken, any herbs in cavities discarded
1 onion, quartered
2 celery ribs, chopped
1 large carrot, chopped
1 head of garlic, halved crosswise
Scant 1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns
2 thyme sprigs
8 parsley sprigs including long stems
4 quarts water

DIRECTIONS

Bring all ingredients to a boil in an 8-qt stockpot. Reduce heat and simmer, skimming foam occasionally, 2 hours.
Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing on and then discarding solids. If you have more than 6 cups, boil to reduce; if less, add water. If using stock right away, skim off and discard fat. If not, chill stock (covered once cool) and discard fat after it solidifies.

Cooks' notes:
• In place of roast-chicken carcasses, you can use 31/2 to 4 lb wings, necks, and backs from uncooked chickens.
• Stock can be chilled up to 3 days or frozen up to 3 months.
